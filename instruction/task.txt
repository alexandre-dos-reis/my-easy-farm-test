You need to make small web app with following requirements:
- An app should have a welcome screen with a start button on the very center of the page
- After clicking on the start you should be presented with the map, where fields are displayed
- You should be able to click on field and see available maps for this field
- You should be able to click on a map to preview it
- During preview app should focus (zoom/center) on the map you are previewing
- You should be able to exit preview screen by clicking on close button
- Maps should either use predefined colors, or be colorised based on the value
- On top left corner the logo should always be visible


Additional info
- You need to use React and Redux (if necessary)
- You can use any template you want as a starting point
- Would be good if you will use TypeScript
- For log map use leaflet hotline or something similar (you probably will need to tranform point to linestring)
- partfield == field (different terms for the same object)
- You should not spend on this task more than 4h
- The use of search engines is not only not prohibited, but also encouraged
